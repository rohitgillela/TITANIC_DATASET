# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns and key influencing factors using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

# Project Overview
The goal of this analysis was to perform a structured EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the Titanic dataset to understand relationships between passenger attributes and survival rates.

# Steps Followed
# 1.Data Loading & Inspection

Imported dataset and performed initial review of shape, columns, and datatypes.

# 2.Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values.

Created new features (e.g., Title extraction, Family size).

# 3.Descriptive Statistics & Exploration

Summary statistics for numeric and categorical features.

Count plots for passenger distribution.

# 4.Visualization & Analysis

Univariate Analysis: Histograms, boxplots, countplots.

Bivariate Analysis: Comparison of numeric & categorical features with survival rate.

Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps before and after encoding categorical features.

Pairplots: Exploring relationships between multiple features.

# 5.Insight Documentation

Observations recorded for each visual.

Summarized findings at the end.

# Key Insights
Survival Rate: ~38%, higher for females and 1st class passengers.

Fare & Cabin: Higher fares and assigned cabins correlated with higher survival probability.

Age Distribution: Majority of passengers aged 20–40 years.

Class Imbalance: Majority of passengers were in 3rd class.

Correlation: Strong link between fare and passenger class.

# Tools & Libraries
Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

# Deliverables
Jupyter Notebook: Full EDA process with code and explanations.

PDF Report: Clean, shareable summary of findings and visuals.
